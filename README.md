To do in app

Change the time period to only show years. The monthly option is for payment and compounding.

So labels only show year increments. And no need to show month anymore.

Growth rate projection (base growth rate , +-0.5, or +-1 or 2% for optimism).(Like flight plans).

Validation for multiple choice of growth rates. Like you can't choose 0.3+-1.

Dividends. Dividends is based on the basic growth rate.
N. Means after how many years the dividends can be collected. (Start period). Num period minus offset date. And then percentage of dividends.
Drop down select of whether dividends are paid out or reinvested. (Still need to press calculate button for dividends) (separate buttons?) if reinvested need different calculation. Maybe stacked graphs(?)

Yes. Separate section for dividends. Dividends is calculated yearly but can add label for the monthly amount (?)
Reset button for dividends. Clear to zero. Dividends can only be activated if the growth setting us zero to only one value

Ask luke what else he needs.
Dividends has its own separate y axis. Because it's on a different scale. Bar chart.
